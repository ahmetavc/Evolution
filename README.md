# INTRODUCTION TO EVOLUTION

Evolution is a survival sandbox environment about creatures competing over food. Players need to implement their brain classes in order to control creatures. Objective of players is to create a brain model that can make creatures to survive the longest in the environment. Everyone can upload their model and challenge their creatures in the simulation. The main aim of this project is to create a suitable environment for students to create their machine learning models feasibly.


# HOW TO PLAY

Before starting to develop your own brain model and playing the game, the only thing interests you about 'evolution simulation' is brain interface. You just basically need to create a brain class in the brains directory by implementing brain interface. You can find the details of the brain interface and the game in the details section.


## Objective ##

Is to create a brain model that can make creatures to survive the longest in the environment by performing perfect actions.


## Getting Started ##

While you are starting to implement your model, if you want, you can check our example brain class implementations. It will be great help for you. 

1-) First of all, you need to create a file in brains directory and create your brain class. You can give any name you want to your brain.

2-) After this step, you need to implement necessary methods from brain interface. You can create your own methods independently.

* You should keep in mind that in every round, every creature calls its brain's methods before making an action. If its new born at that round, it calls birth. If if it dies at that round, it calls death method of its brain.

Examples of calls of creatures:

* When a creature is born
```
creature.brain.birth(np.copy(self.creatureStats), worldViewOfCreature = np.copy(worldmap.getEnvironmentOfCreature(self)), parentBrain = parentBrain)
```

* When a creature is performing an action
```
action = creature.brain.act(np.copy(self.creatureStats),np.copy(worldViewOfCreature))
```

* When a creature dies
```
creature.death(creatureStats = np.copy(creature.creatureStats), worldViewOfCreature = np.copy(self.worldmap.getEnvironmentOfCreature(creature)), score = copy.copy(creature.creatureStats[creature.POS_ALIVECOUNTER]))
```

And you are ready to test your model. You can run simulation by executing run.py file.

# DETAILS OF THE GAME

The game consists of 4 components:

* Worldmap
* Creature
* Brain
* Zoo


## Worldmap ##

The map consists of 3 components:

* Food
* Humidity
* Height


At the beginning, the world is automatically generated. The humidity and height map is generated by applying a gaussian filter over random noise. Depending on the choosen percentage of water coverage, a specific height is choosen to be the actualy water level height. Everywhere with heigth level below to that water level become sea. Then, the simulation starts.

After simulation started, at the beginning of every turn, specific number of creatures are relased to the environment and vegetation level on map is initialized. Each turn restarts when there is no more creatures on the map.

Each round, the vegetation grows depending on the water level at that spot. It cannot exceed 1.0 in value.
After that, every create in the list can perform exactly one action.

The edges of the map are not borders. When a creature passes a edge, it comes up from opposite edge. Therefore the worldmap is like sphere.


## Creature ##

The creature consists of 5 features:


#### brain ####

Brain is the control unit of every creature. Every creatures are belong to one specific brain and actions of the creatures in every round of game are decided by the brains of the creatures. Brain is set immidiately after the creature's birth.


#### health (float) ####

* Creatures' life span is 0 and 1. Its health cannot exceed 1 without looking at how much it eats. 
* Creatures become dead when their health is equal or below to 0, the creature is declared dead an will not be updated any more.


####  position (int)

* Creatures have a X and Y positions and the worldmap. This features decides the place of creatures on the map.


#### alive (boolean) ####

* Its shows whether the creature is alive or not.


#### action (int) ####

Creatures can perform 6 different actions:

* Movement by one tile up/left/down/right

* Eat (Vegetation level at current location is added to own health, and vegetation becomes 0 at that location)

* Reproduce (Create a copy of itself, dividing it's health over both. After that, the health of the creature is reduced by a fixed amount.)

Creatures can only see limited amount of the map. They can only see their close surroundings.


## Brain

Its a interface that you should follow while you are implementing your machine learning model.

It consists of a constructor and 5 abstract method;


#### __init ####

parameters:

* numberOfActions (int, the number of possible actions that creatures can perform)
* creatureStatsShape (int, the shape of the creature stats array)
* worldViewShape (tuple, shape of the creature view array)

It returns nothing.


#### getId ####

* It has no parameters.
* It returns string as the ID of the brain implementation.


#### brightness ####
* It has no parameters.
* It returns float as the brightness of the brain's creatures' image.


#### birth ####

This method is called by the game whenever a creature of this brain is created.

Parameters;

* creatureStats (stats of the creature, its a 1D np array and consists of creature's position X, position Y, health, alive and alive counter)
* worldViewOfCreature (stats of the creature's environment, its a 3D np array and consists of 4 layers. Layers are respectively height, water depth, humidity and vegatiation. First two dimensions represents the tiles.)
* parentBrain (its the brain object of parent of the creature. If there is no parent of the creature, its null)

Its returns nothing.


#### act ####

This method is called by the game whenever a creature needs to perform an action.

Parameters;

* creatureStats (stats of the creature, its a 1D np array and consists of creature's position X, position Y, health, alive and alive counter)
* worldViewOfCreature (stats of the creature's environment, its a 3D np array and consists of 4 layers. Layers are respectively height, water depth, humidity and vegatiation. First two dimensions represents the tiles.)

It returns int as action;

* 0 - move left
* 1 - move up
* 2 - move right
* 3 = move down
* 5 - eat
* 6 - reproduce


#### death ####

This method is called by the game whenever a creature dies.

Parameters;

* creatureStats (stats of the creature, its a 1D np array and consists of creature's position X, position Y, health, alive and alive counter)
* worldViewOfCreature (stats of the creature's environment, its a 3D np array and consists of 4 layers. Layers are respectively height, water depth, humidity and vegatiation. First two dimensions represents the tiles.)
* score (its the number of alive rounds of the creature as int)

It returns nothing.


## Zoo ##

The best ten creatures are kept in the zoo in order to print the rank in game.
