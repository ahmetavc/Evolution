# Evolution

Evolution is a survival sandbox environment about creatures competing over food.

The world consists of 4 components:

Humidity
Height
Vegetation
Creatures

At the beginning, the world is automatically generated. The humidity and height map is generated by applying a gaussian filter over random noise. Depending on the choosen percentage of water coverage, a specific height is choosen to be the actualy water level height. Then, the simulation starts.

Each round, the vegetation grows depending on the water level at that spot. It cannot exceed 1.0 in value.
After that, every create in the list can perform exactly one action. The actions are:

Movement by one tile up/left/down/right
or
Eat (Vegetation level at current location is added to own health)
or
Reproduce (Create a copy of itself, dividing it's health over both)

After that, the health of the creature is reduced by a fixed amount.
If the health is equal  or below zero, the creature is declared dead an will not be updated any more.

Every creature has a brain. Brain implemantations should be in the brains folder and should inherit brain interface.
